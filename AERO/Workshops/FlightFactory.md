Join us for a hands-on practical workshop in aeromodelling and RC aircraft technology, enabling you to design, fabricate, and pilot a fixed-wing RC aircraft. This isn't just a workshop - IT'S YOUR CHANCE TO CARVE AND FLY A FULLY FUNCTIONAL RC PLANE, that too FROM SCRATCH!

## Speaker

- **Gouthami T S**
- **Jitendra Saini**
- **Company: AEROGO BANGLORE**

## Objectives
- To provide students with hands-on practical knowledge (Fixed wing kits will be provided) in aeromodelling and RC aircraft 
technology
- Enabling students to design, fabricate, and pilot a fixed-wing RC aircraft
  
## Outcomes
