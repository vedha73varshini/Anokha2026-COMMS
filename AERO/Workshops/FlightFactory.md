
## Flight Factory
Join us for a two day hands on learning experience for students who want to build, not just listen. Explore aerodynamics, 3D design, fabrication, and piloting while creating a fixed wing RC aircraft step by step. It is your chance to design, build, and fly a fully functional RC plane from scratch.


## Speaker

- **Gouthami T S**
- **Jitendra Saini**
- **Company: AEROGO BANGLORE**

## Objectives
- To provide students with hands-on practical knowledge in aeromodelling and RC aircraft 
technology
- Enabling students to design, fabricate, and pilot a fixed-wing RC aircraft
  
## Outcomes
- Design fixed-wing aircraft from aerodynamic and aeromodelling first principles.
- Fabricate airframes using reliable techniques.
- Wire and integrate flight control systems and RC electronics.
- Execute pre-flight checks and safety protocols.
- Pilot your creation under professional supervision.
