# Build2Break

Dive into the ultimate software engineering challenge at Build2Break, where teams design and deploy robust systems before switching roles to stress-test and exploit vulnerabilities in competitors' creations. Experience the complete software lifecycle through this intense three-stage competition that combines development excellence with adversarial testing, pushing your technical skills and strategic thinking to the limit.

## Rules and Regulations

- Students must register in teams of **2–4 members** to participate.
- Teams may only use **permitted data and resources**. Use of unauthorized or private data is strictly prohibited.
- **Offensive or inappropriate content** is not allowed in systems, datasets, or demonstrations.
- Any violation of the rules may result in **disqualification** and further action by the organizers.

---

## Event Structure

Each team must design and implement a **functional system** under one of the three specialized tracks:
**Track A, Track B, or Track C**.

---

## Build Phase

During the build phase, teams must:

- Design and implement a system with a **clear architecture**
- Create **runnable artifacts** such as a container image, VM image, or hosted instance
- Provide a **publicly accessible source code repository**
- Include a **README** with reproduction steps, dependencies, and an evaluation guide
- Submit a **technical design note** describing architecture, datasets used, and known limitations
- Prepare a **basic test suite or sample inputs** for verification

---

## Break Phase

Competing teams will attempt to:

- Identify and exploit **flaws** in submitted systems
- Break system functionality using **edge cases and stress testing**
- Document findings with **proof-of-concept evidence** and clear reproduction steps
- Demonstrate the **severity and impact** of discovered issues to the judges

---

## Event Duration and Participation

- This is a **continuous 24-hour event**
- Teams must maintain their **presence and active participation** throughout the event
- Late arrivals or absence of team members may result in **penalties or disqualification**

---

## Submission Format

All submissions must include:

1. Runnable artifact (container image, VM image, or hosted instance)
2. Public source code repository link or access credentials
3. README with exact reproduction steps, dependencies, and resource requirements
4. Technical design note describing architecture, models, datasets, and system design
5. Basic test suite or sample inputs for verification

---

## Data and Intellectual Property

- Teams retain full ownership of their **code, systems, and artifacts**
- By submitting, teams grant the organizers **non-exclusive rights** to use submissions for judging, publicity, and future educational purposes

---
## Judging Process & Reproducibility

- Judges will run the submitted artifacts on **provided hardware** or **judge-hosted infrastructure**, strictly following the instructions in the supplied README.
- Each **Build phase system** will be evaluated against all valid **Break phase submissions** applicable to its respective track.
- **Break submissions** may be assessed across multiple target systems where relevant.
- If judges are unable to **reproduce a submission** within the allotted time using the provided instructions, **reproducibility-related points may be reduced**.
- The **top 10 teams** will be invited to present their systems and approaches to the **final judging panel**.
