# Auction Arena
A cricket simulation event designed to test participants on strategy, decision making, and financial planning. For the first time in the history of our auction events, the experience mirrors a real player auction, bringing added realism and intensity to the bidding floor. Teams will compete in a fast-paced, single-day auction to build a balanced and competitive squad within a fixed virtual budget.
