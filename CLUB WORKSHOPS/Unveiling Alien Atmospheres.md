## Unveiling Alien Atmospheres with JWST: A Hands-On Exoplanet Workshop 

Unlock the secrets of distant worlds with this high-energy, hands-on workshop powered by real JWST exoplanet data! You'll analyse alien atmospheres, run powerful Python tools, and watch features like water vapour and clouds reveal themselves in live-generated spectra. With guided access to PetitRADTRANS, you'll experience how real researchers decode planets light-years away.

## Speaker

- **Name**: Dr. Vigneshwaran Krishnamurthy
- **Company**: Trottier Space Institute, McGill University

Dr. Vigneshwaran Krishnamurthy is a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University's Trottier Space Institute, where he studies exoplanets and their atmospheres using cutting-edge space and ground-based observations. His work blends advanced spectroscopy with atmospheric modelling to uncover the physical and chemical diversity of distant worlds. Dr. Krishnamurthy is also committed to science outreach and interactive learning that makes astrophysics exciting and accessible.


## Objectives
- Introduce participants to exoplanet atmospheric science using JWST data and spectroscopy techniques.
- Learn practical Python-based spectral analysis skills.
- Demonstrate atmospheric modelling with PetitRADTRANS software.
- Get to know how to interpret key spectral signatures in exoplanet data.
  
## Outcomes
- Analyse real JWST exoplanet data using Python-based spectroscopy tools.
- Identify and interpret key spectral signatures such as water vapor and clouds in exoplanet atmospheres.
