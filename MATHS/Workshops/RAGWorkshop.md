# Build the Brain: RAG + Agentic AI That Thinks for You
This two-day, hands-on workshop focuses on building real-world GenAI applications using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LoRA/QLoRA-based fine-tuning, and multi-agent AI systems. Participants will design end-to-end RAG pipelines, automate workflows with coordinated agents, and explore scalable, industry-aligned AI practices.[1]

## Speaker

- **Name**: Achintya Singh
- **Company: Name of the company**: 21Coders
- Achintya Singh is the founder of 21Coders, a fast-growing tech community with over 256k followers, and a software engineer working across GenAI, Web, Mobile, and Blockchain technologies; he is known for practical, future-focused, hands-on training sessions that turn concepts into deployable applications.

## Objectives

- Introduce foundational concepts of GenAI, RAG, and modern fine-tuning techniques like LoRA/QLoRA.
- Enable participants to build a complete, production-style RAG pipeline end-to-end.
- Familiarize learners with the design and coordination of multi-agent AI systems for automation workflows.
- Provide practical exposure to deploying AI workflows using GPU-enabled or cloud-based environments.
- Bridge academic understanding with industry practices through project-oriented sessions.

## Outcomes

- Ability to design and implement a basic RAG-based GenAI application.
- Hands-on experience in fine-tuning models using LoRA/QLoRA for custom tasks.
- Practical understanding of multi-agent workflows for automation and orchestration.
- Improved readiness to build and extend AI prototypes aligned with current industry tools and stacks.
