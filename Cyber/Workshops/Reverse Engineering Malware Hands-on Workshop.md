## Reverse Engineering Malware Hands-on Workshop
The event will equip participants with foundational and practical skills in reverse engineering and malware analysis using real-world tools and techniques. It will provide hands-on exposure to analyzing malicious binaries through both static and dynamic approaches in a secure sandboxed environment and will also develop participants’ ability to easily understand and solve CTF challenges related to reverse engineering.


## Speaker

- **Dr Vipin Pavithran**<br>
  Founder and Managing Director, Traboda Cyberlabs, Edapally, Kochi, Kerala <br>
  Dr. Vipin Pavithran is the Founder and Managing Director of Traboda Cyberlabs, where he leads a team committed to advancing cybersecurity innovation and training. As the founder and chief mentor of Team bi0s, India’s #1 and globally top-ranked cybersecurity team, Dr. Vipin has been instrumental in shaping the country’s cybersecurity talent. 

## Objectives
- Participants are actively taught to work on Reverse Engineering CTF challenges, which help them to practically apply the things they learnt in the session
- Use a live sandbox environment to analyze malware behaviour safely, allowing participants to practically observe system modifications, persistence techniques, and network activities.
- Teaching participants to properly document in the form of a Malware Analysis Report
- Provides exposure to a diversified tool-stack including Ghidra, IDA Free, x64dbg, Wireshark, Process Monitor, and PE analysis tools
  
## Outcomes
- Participants will gain the ability to perform both static and dynamic analysis of malware samples using professional tools
-  Improved understanding of assembly language flow, binary structure, and disassembly concepts, enabling reverse-engineering of executable files
- Strengthened employment readiness for roles in malware research, reverse engineering, incident response, SOC operations, and digital forensics
- Participants will confidently approach reverse engineering CTF-style problems, applying analytical reasoning, tool usage, and debugging skills
