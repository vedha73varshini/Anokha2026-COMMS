## Agentic AIoT Workshop

n this workshop, we move beyond "smart" gadgets that just follow orders to build Agentic AIoT—systems where devices actually think for themselves. You’ll learn how to give hardware a digital "brain," teaching software agents to reason, make decisions, and take real-world action. By bridging the gap between intelligent code and physical sensors, you'll walk away knowing how to turn a simple device into a truly autonomous teammate capable of solving problems on its own.

## Speaker

- **Name**: Mr. Mohan V
- **Company**: Application Developer at Oracle

Mr. Mohan V is an alumnus of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore. He has a strong professional and research experience in IoT, Artificial Intelligence, AIoT, and Agentic Systems, with a focus on building intelligent, real-world applications.

## Objectives

- Introduce participants to the emerging field of Agentic AIoT
- Understand how agent-based frameworks can autonomously reason, act, and interact with real-world devices, enabling smarter edge solutions.
- Build end-to-end AIoT pipeline from software agents to on-device implementation
  
## Outcomes
- Understand the fundamentals of agentic systems and their role in modern AIoT architectures.
- Explore how software agents can plan, reason, and perform tasks autonomously.
- Learn how real-time sensing, inference, and decision-making work together in edge environments.
- Build confidence to design small-scale agentic AIoT applications and extend them into larger projects or competitions.
