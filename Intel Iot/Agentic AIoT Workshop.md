## Agentic AIoT Workshop

Move beyond command driven smart devices and step into Agentic AIoT, where hardware can think, decide, and act on its own. Learn how to give devices a digital brain that connects intelligent code with real world sensors, turning simple hardware into autonomous systems that solve problems independently.

## Speaker

- **Name**: Mr. Mohan V
- **Company**: Application Developer at Oracle

Mr. Mohan V is an alumnus of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore. He has a strong professional and research experience in IoT, Artificial Intelligence, AIoT, and Agentic Systems, with a focus on building intelligent, real-world applications.

## Objectives

- Introduce participants to the emerging field of Agentic AIoT
- Understand how agent-based frameworks can autonomously reason, act, and interact with real-world devices, enabling smarter edge solutions.
- Build end-to-end AIoT pipeline from software agents to on-device implementation
  
## Outcomes
- Understand the fundamentals of agentic systems and their role in modern AIoT architectures.
- Explore how software agents can plan, reason, and perform tasks autonomously.
- Learn how real-time sensing, inference, and decision-making work together in edge environments.
- Build confidence to design small-scale agentic AIoT applications and extend them into larger projects or competitions.
