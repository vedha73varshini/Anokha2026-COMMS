Agentic AIoT Workshop :
By inteliotclub.

Objective

The workshop aims to introduce participants to the emerging field of Agentic AIoT by blending intelligent software agents with IoT hardware systems. It helps participants understand how agent-based frameworks can autonomously reason, act, and interact with real-world devices, enabling smarter edge solutions. The session prepares students to build end-to-end AIoT pipeline from software agents to on-device implementation.

Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

Understand the fundamentals of agentic systems and their role in modern AIoT architectures.

Explore how software agents can plan, reason, and perform tasks autonomously.

Gain hands-on exposure to integrating AI-driven agents with IoT hardware.

Learn how real-time sensing, inference, and decision-making work together in edge environments.

Build confidence to design small-scale agentic AIoT applications and extend them into larger projects or competitions.
