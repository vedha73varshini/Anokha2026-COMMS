Step into generative design with an introductory workshop using Fusion 360, focused on building intuitive and efficient design workflows.
Explore and build a strong foundation in setting design goals, applying constraints, selecting materials, and running generative design studies with ease.


## Speaker

- **Robinsons Charles**
- **Company: USAM Solutions, Coimbatore**

## Objectives
- To introduce participants how to set design goals, add constraints, and use Fusion 360 to create generative design models.
- To help learners understand basic simulation, material selection, and optimisation concepts needed for better engineering designs.

  
## Outcomes
- Participants will be able to run generative design studies and choose the best design from the results.
- Participants will gain practical skills to create lighter, stronger, and more efficient
