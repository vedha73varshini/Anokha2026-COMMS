# Trial by Ink & Intellect – Character Courtroom Challenge

A unique collaborative event by Clarion – The Writing Wing of Srishti and the Debate Society. Participants will engage in a character-building and argumentation challenge where writers craft original character sketches and debaters put those characters on trial in a courtroom-style format.
Writers create compelling fictional personalities; debaters interrogate, defend, or critique the characters; and the audience participates as the jury. The event blends storytelling, improvisation, argumentation, and creativity—designed to spotlight expressive writing and sharp debating prowess.
