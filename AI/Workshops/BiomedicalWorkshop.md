# Hands-on Training in Biomedical Signal Acquisition, Processing, and Rehabilitation Robotics using ECG, EMG, PPG, and PCG

This hands-on workshop trains participants to acquire, process, and analyze biomedical signals such as ECG, EMG, PPG, and PCG, and apply them in rehabilitation robotics. It covers the end-to-end workflow from biosignal acquisition to feature extraction and introduces how these signals can drive AI-driven assistive and rehabilitation technologies.

## Speaker
### Dr. Ashmi M
**Head, Department of Mechatronics, ACE College of Engineering**
Dr. Ashmi’s expertise spans biomechanics, rehabilitation engineering, and assistive technologies. She previously served as Lead Project Scientist on an ICMR-funded NCAHT project in collaboration with IIT Delhi and IIT Madras. Her extensive research and industry-oriented experience will guide participants through the workshop.

## Objectives

- Equip participants with practical skills in acquiring, processing, and analyzing biomedical signals (ECG, EMG, PPG, PCG).  
- Introduce the use of biomedical signals for rehabilitation robotics, robotic control, and system evaluation.  
- Build a foundation for intelligent assistive technology development using biosignal-driven approaches.  

## Outcomes

- Participants will complete the full workflow from signal acquisition to processing and feature extraction.  
- Participants will integrate multiple physiological signals (ECG, EMG, PPG, PCG) with rehabilitation/assistive robotic applications.  
- Participants will explore AI/ML applications using multimodal biosignal data for control or evaluation of assistive systems.
