# Farm Fiesta
A four-level challenge that puts your teamwork and nature knowledge to the test. You’ll start by competing in 40 teams, racing to sort seeds and playing a fast-paced guessing game with your partner. As the rounds progress, you'll need to think quickly to build "word chains" of crops and use your eyes to match different plant leaves.
