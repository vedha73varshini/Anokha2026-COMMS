- You are free to choose which issues to work upon. The official-bot of AmSoC will assign the issue to you upon commenting `/assign` in the comments of the issue.',
- As there can be multiple participants working on an issue at the same time, speed and quality of solution are of essence.
- The use of AI tools is permitted but complete reliance on AI-generated code that does not follow the conventions of the repository will lead to rejections.
- Avoid using copyrighted code. Please be honest with yourself. If detected, this is punishable through penalties.
- The final decision on rewarding a participant rests with the maintainers ONLY.
- Maintainers will label issues with `AMSOC-ACCEPTED` tag to indicate their eligibility for the program. New issues introduced by the participants in the form of bugs (or) feature requests; can be worked upon only after approval from maintainers.
- Read the `CONTRIBUTION.md` file present in each project carefully before contributing to the project.
- In order to curb spamming, we have introduced penalties. A maintainer is free to reward a penalty to a contributor in cases of spamming and misdemeanour which will lead to reduction of total bounty.
