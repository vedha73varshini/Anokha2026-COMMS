# ACM Winter of Code (WoC) 2.0

- Winter of Code (WoC) 2.0 is the second edition of the ACM Student Chapter’s flagship open source coding event, held as part of Anokha 2026.
- The event aims to introduce participants to the world of open source by giving them hands-on experience with real projects.
- Participants get to explore open-source projects with issues of different difficulty levels.
- Participants choose issues they are interested in and start working on it.
- The event follows a race-based system, where multiple people work on the same issue and the fastest pull request is reviewed first.
- If a pull request meets the project maintainer's requirements, it is merged and the issue is closed. If it fails to meet said requirements, changes are requested and the next pull request is reviewed.
- Points are awarded for merged pull requests based on the type and difficulty of the issue, along with bonuses and penalties.
- A live leaderboard tracks points and ranks participants throughout the event.
- WoC focuses on learning and personal growth by helping participants learn new skills, explore the latest technological landscape, and be a part of a strong open-source community at Amrita. The event is open to participants of all academic years and experience levels.

## Rules
- Ensure you have a personal GitHub account.
- As participants, you can submit issues and bug-reports. Please do follow the guidelines setup by maintainers of the project.
- Write clean and concise commit messages. Additionally, write detailed descriptions and titles in your pull requests.
- You are free to choose which issues to work upon. The official-bot of AmSoC will assign the issue to you upon commenting `/assign` in the comments of the issue.',
- As there can be multiple participants working on an issue at the same time, speed and quality of solution are of essence.
- The use of AI tools is permitted but complete reliance on AI-generated code that does not follow the conventions of the repository will lead to rejections.
- Avoid using copyrighted code. Please be honest with yourself. If detected, this is punishable through penalties.
- The final decision on rewarding a participant rests with the maintainers ONLY.
- Maintainers will label issues with `AMSOC-ACCEPTED` tag to indicate their eligibility for the program. New issues introduced by the participants in the form of bugs (or) feature requests; can be worked upon only after approval from maintainers.
- Read the `CONTRIBUTION.md` file present in each project carefully before contributing to the project.
- In order to curb spamming, we have introduced penalties. A maintainer is free to reward a penalty to a contributor in cases of spamming and misdemeanour which will lead to reduction of total bounty.
