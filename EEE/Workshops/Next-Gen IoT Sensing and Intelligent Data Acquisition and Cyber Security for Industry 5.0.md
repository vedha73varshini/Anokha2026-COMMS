##  Hands-on Workshop: Next-Gen IoT Sensing and Intelligent Data Acquisition and Cyber Security for Industry 5.0
This workshop is built around a Cyber Defense Challenge, where participants construct an IoTcontrolled system and then face simulated enemy cyber attacks. Participants will learn to develop IoT sensing systems, cloud-based dashboards, and automation platforms, forming the digital infrastructure to be protected.

Participants will witness live cyber attacks, including Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and False Data Injection, to understand how real-world systems are compromised. The challenge phase divides participants into Attack and Defense units, one unit attempts to breach the system, while the other works to detect intrusions, secure data, and defend the infrastructure. This challenge-driven format highlights the critical balance between cyber attacks and cyber security.

## Objectives
• To provide hands-on experience in IoT system development and cloud integration
• To demonstrate live cyber attacks (MITM and False Data Injection) on IoT systems
• To train participants in both cyber attack and defence strategies
• To simulate real-world cyber warfare scenarios in a controlled environment
  
## Outcomes
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
• Build and deploy IoT dashboards and sensor networks
• Understand and perform MITM and False Data Injection attacks
• Identify vulnerabilities and apply basic security countermeasures
• Appreciate the balance between attacking and defending digital systems
• Gain practical exposure to IoT cyber security challenges
