##  Next-Gen IoT Sensing and Intelligent Data Acquisition and Cyber Security for Industry 5.0
This workshop aims towards advanced sensors and edge computation to enable fast, accurate, and context-aware data processing. These systems reduce latency by shifting intelligence to the edge and ensuring scalability through cloud integration with industrial boards integrated to smart sensors for varied real-time applications. Basic cybersecurity practices will be demonstrated with Man in the Middle (MITM) and False Data Injection Attack (FDIA).
